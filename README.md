# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis & Interactive Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview
This project transforms raw retail data into an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales performance for a global coffee company. The goal was to provide stakeholders with a "single pane of glass" to monitor revenue trends, identify high-value customers, and understand product preferences across different markets.

### 📊 Key Insights Generated
1. Regional Dominance: The United States significantly outperforms the UK and Ireland in total revenue, suggesting a mature market with high volume.

2. Product Trends: Sales for Arabica and Robusta show high month-to-month volatility, indicating a need for better inventory management during peak seasons.

3. Customer Loyalty: A small percentage of "Top 10" customers contribute a significant portion of total sales, validating the importance of the Loyalty Card program.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
1. To build this dashboard, I utilized advanced Excel features to ensure data integrity and interactivity:

2. Data Cleaning (Power Query): Handled missing values, standardized date formats, and merged multiple tables (Orders, Customers, Products).

3. Advanced Formulas: Leveraged XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and IF statements to create a dynamic data model.

4. Pivot Tables & Charts: Aggregated thousands of rows into digestible visualizations.

5. Interactive UI: * Timeline Slicer: For granular date filtering (2019–2022).

6. Categorical Slicers: To filter by Roast Type, Package Size, and Loyalty Card status.

7. Dynamic Formatting: Used a professional color palette to ensure readability and accessibility.

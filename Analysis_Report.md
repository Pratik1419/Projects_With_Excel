📊 Project Analysis Report: Coffee Retail Sales (2019-2022)
1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes the sales performance of a coffee retail business over a three-year period. By examining product types, roast levels, and customer loyalty, the goal was to identify growth drivers and areas for operational improvement.

2. Sales Trend Analysis
Volatile Growth: Total sales across all four coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) show significant month-over-month fluctuations.

Peak Periods: Notable spikes occurred in mid-2020 and mid-2021, suggesting successful seasonal promotions or external market factors.

Product Performance: No single coffee bean type consistently dominated the market; however, Arabica and Liberica showed the highest peaks in revenue, often exceeding $800 USD in top-performing months.

3. Geographical Market Share
Primary Market: The United States is the flagship market, contributing over $35,000 in total revenue—more than triple the combined revenue of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Growth Opportunities: With the UK and Ireland hovering below $10,000, there is a significant opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns to increase market penetration in the European sector.

4. Customer Insights & Loyalty
The Pareto Principle: A small group of top-tier customers, led by Allis Wilmore and Terri Farra, drive a disproportionate amount of revenue (averaging $250–$320 per customer).

Loyalty Card Impact: Initial data suggests that high-spending customers are frequently "Yes" for Loyalty Cards.

Recommendation: Increase the signup incentive for the Loyalty Card program in the UK and Ireland to mirror US success.
